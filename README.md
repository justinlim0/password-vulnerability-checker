# Password-Vulnerability-Checker
This project estimates the vulnerability of a given password using measurements of entropy, and cross referencing it with lists of weak passwords.<br>
Additionally, it gives the option to run bruteforce attacks on the password to test a hypothetical cracking algorithm.

## Password_strength.java

In this file, two methods of password analysis occur in order to determine the strength of a password.<br>
The first method is where the password strength is mathematically determined with a maximum of 128 bits of entropy, and then converted into a 10 point scale.

### Entropy
In basic cryptography and cybersecurity, entropy is the concept of unpredictability in an encryption key. The higher the entropy, the harder it is for a hacker to crack a password, and the more computing power it takes to execute such a task.<br>
With thorough research, I determined that measuring entropy would be the most effective way at determining a secure password while maintaining practicality.

Entropy is calculated by multiplying log base of 2 with the total number of different characters used in a password (C) to the power of the length of the password (L).<br>
With the inclusion of 128 bits as the maximum, and a conversion to a 10 point scale as mentioned earlier, the equation for an entropy rating is...<br>

<b>E=\frac{log\ ₂\ \left(C^L\right)}{maxE}\cdot10</b>

When the user is prompted to input a password, there are suggestions in order to ensure that a decent level of password entropy is met. These suggestions are using a symbol, two numbers, and at least 5 letters. This automatically makes a password more effective than a simple, plaintext word.

An extra whitelist filter is implemented for when the user inputs a string with obscure symbols, many of which do not fall under organizations' standards. Some of these inappropriate characters include ')', '+', 'Δ', 'δ', all of which are impractical for a password registration and login. Therefore, the program only accepts '!', '@', '#', '$', '%', '^', '&', '*', '_', and '-' as valid non-alphanumerical characters.

### Dictionary Attack

However, no matter how effective this method may be on its own, it is even further fortified by putting ourselves into the perspective of a hacker. A hacker does not expect the average person to memorize a key of random sequences or to think solely about entropy value. A hacker would simply refer to a list of common passwords, dictionary words, and/or phrases of their target's language.<br>

This is called a "dictionary attack", and the second method of password analysis in this program is implementing one.<br>

BufferedReader and FileReader objects are used to scan text document files that are too large to be contained in the same place as the Java programs. The first text document is a list of the top 50 most common passwords in 2024 by GeeksforGeeks, and the second file is a much more extensive list of 1 million common words and sequences(sources below).<br>

If there is a direct match in either file, the password is deemed very weak(when the badPassword boolean is passed later in the code). A partial match with the 1 million line document, wherein a line from it is contained in the password, two whole points out of a 10 point scale is docked off.
