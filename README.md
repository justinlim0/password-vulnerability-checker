# Password-Vulnerability-Checker
This project estimates the vulnerability of a given password using measurements of entropy, and cross referencing it with lists of weak passwords.<br>

Additionally, it gives the option to run bruteforce attacks on the password to test a hypothetical cracking algorithm.

## Password_strength.java

In this file, two methods of password analysis are put into place to estimate the strength of a password.<br>
The first method is where the password strength is mathematically determined with a maximum of 128 bits of entropy, and then converted into a 10 point scale.

### Entropy
In basic cryptography and cybersecurity, entropy is the concept of unpredictability in a password, encryption, or decryption key. The higher the entropy, the harder it is for a hacker to crack a password, and the more computing power it takes to execute such a task.<br>

Through research, I determined that measuring entropy would be the most effective way of determining a secure password, while maintaining practicality.

Entropy is calculated by multiplying log base of 2 with the total number of different characters used in a password (C) to the power of the length of the password (L).<br>
With the inclusion of 128 bits as the maximum, and a conversion to a 10 point scale as mentioned earlier, the equation for an entropy rating is...<br>

$$E=\frac{log\ ₂\ \left(C^L\right)}{maxE}\cdot 10$$

When the user is prompted to input a password, there are suggestions in order to ensure that a decent level of password entropy is met. These suggestions are to use a symbol, two numbers, and at least 5 letters. This automatically makes a password more effective than a simple, plaintext word. However, in combination with the secondary password analysis method, it is not guaranteed to bring a Moderate or higher rating.

An extra whitelist filter is implemented for when the user inputs a string with obscure symbols, many of which do not fall under organizations' standards. Some of these inappropriate characters include ')', '+', 'Δ', 'δ', all of which are impractical for a password registration and login. Therefore, the program only accepts '!', '@', '#', '$', '%', '^', '&', '*', '_', and '-' as valid non-alphanumerical characters.

### Dictionary Attack
However, no matter how effective this method may be on its own, it is even further fortified by putting ourselves into the perspective of a hacker. A hacker does not expect the average person to memorize a key of random sequences or to think solely about entropy value. A hacker would simply refer to a list of common passwords, dictionary words, and/or phrases of their target's language.<br>

This is called a "dictionary attack", and the second method of password analysis in this program is implementing one.<br>

BufferedReader and FileReader objects are used to scan text document files that are too large to be contained in the same place as the Java programs. The first text document is a list of the top 50 most common passwords in 2024 by GeeksforGeeks, and the second file is a much more extensive list of 1 million common words and sequences(sources below).<br>

If there is a direct match in either file, the password is deemed very weak(when the badPassword boolean is passed later in the code). A partial match with the 1 million line document, wherein a line from it is contained in the password, two whole points out of a 10 point scale is docked off.

## Bruteforce.java

This program implements a recursive algorithm to crack a given password. It is hypothetically foolproof, however it would take a ridiculous amount of time to execute. This is simply to demonstrate the concept of entropy, and to put into practice recursive cracking algorithms used in true brute force attacks. Furthermore, the hypothesis that the entropy of a password scales with the processing power of an attacker's computer holds true with this method of password cracking.

### Recursion
Recursion, in computer science, is a method that utilizes self-calling functions in order to solve the same problem. In Java, recursive algorithms use static methods because they rely on parameters instead of instance variables.

The recursive method is static as it repeatedly calls itself with the current password guess, each time concatenated with another character.<br>

As a result of infinite recursion, a stack overflow is the most common error associated with this brute force method; even with a short string of letters, a stack overflow is likely to happen.<br>

To expand, brute force attacks are hypothetically foolproof but in practice, they could take several years. The goal of making a secure password, therefore, is to make a hacker's job signifcantly harder in this regard.

## Conclusion

In the digital age, with the rise of quantum computers and complex hacking techniques being developed every day, the war between black hat and white hat hackers only grows. However, it is everyone's responsibility to maintain online safety and build secure passwords to protect their personal data. Try this program for yourself and see how difficult it may be to do so.
