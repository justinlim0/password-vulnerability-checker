# Password-Vulnerability-Checker
This project estimates the vulnerability of a given password using measurements of entropy, and cross referencing extensive lists of weak passwords.
Additionally, it gives the option to run bruteforce attacks on the password to test its practicality.

##Password_strength.java

In this file, the password analysis occurs where the strength is mathematically determined by a max of 128 bits of entropy.

###Entropy
In basic cryptography and cybersecurity, entropy is the concept of unpredictability in an encryption key. The higher the entropy, the harder it is for a hacker to crack a password, and the more computing power it takes to execute such a task.
