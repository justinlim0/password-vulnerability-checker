# Password-Vulnerability-Checker
This project estimates the vulnerability of a given password using measurements of entropy, and cross referencing extensive lists of weak passwords.
Additionally, it gives the option to run bruteforce attacks on the password to test its practicality.

In this file, two methods of password analysis occur in order to 
The first method is where the password strength is mathematically determined with a max of 128 bits of entropy.

### Entropy
In basic cryptography and cybersecurity, entropy is the concept of unpredictability in an encryption key. The higher the entropy, the harder it is for a hacker to crack a password, and the more computing power it takes to execute such a task.
There are few cases in which a password can be, however, with thorough research I determined that this would be the most effective way at determining a secure password while maintaining practicality.

Entropy is calculated by taking the total of different characters used in the password (the character pool) to the power of the length of the password, multiplied by log base of 2.
With the inclusion of 128 bits as the maximum, and a conversion to a 10 point scale, the equation in full is...
$$ E = \frac{\log_2(C^2)}{\text{maxE}} \times 10 $$

When the user is prompted to input a password, there are suggestions in order to ensure that a decent level of password entropy is met. 

However effective this one method may be, it is even further fortified by thinking from the perspective of a hacker. A hacker does not expect the average person to memorize a key of random sequences, with
as high a character set as possibe
